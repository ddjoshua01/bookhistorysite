                <h1>1. The Little Engine That Could</h1>
                <p1><i>The Little Engine That Could</i>  is truly inspiring. It is a tale of perseverance, optimism, and hard work while also perhaps hiding a story of the good Samaritan. A train, responsible for delivering toys to children, breaks down. Multiple big and strong trains pass, but none are willing to help. Eventually, the Little Engine comes along. They don’t seem as capable as the other engines, but through their optimism, they decide to give it a go. The little engine perseveres, and gets the job done, a gripping story, told in a way understandable by all ages, making it one of my favorite children’s books. </p1>

                <h1>2. Diary of a Wimpy Kid</h1>
                <p1><i>Diary of a Wimpy Kid</i> is a journal, not a diary. It is the journal of Greg Heffley, a funny, awkward, but harmless sixth grader, until you watch a documentary and find out he’s a sociopath. Anyway, Greg’s journal is 217 pages long, in which he tells of his wacky middle school antics and outside of school adventures. Often, these stories involve his friend Rowley, a much more innocent sixth grader who often gets caught up in Greg’s antics. The Diary of a Wimpy Kid series combines small blocks of text with simple illustrations, which helped me a lot when I was an early reader. It even helps now, since my short attention span for reading isn’t a problem with the Diary of a Wimpy Kid Series. Overall, I believe this series is great for all ages, even if Greg is a sociopath.

                <h1>3. Class Dismissed</h1>
                <p1><i>Class Dismissed</i> Class Dismissed is a book filled with character development, yet still fit for a young reader. It tells the surprisingly compelling story of a 5th grade classroom, which has become teacherless after a mix up. The 5th graders decide to keep this a secret, and as the school year unfolds, more and more problems arise, calling for new characters to develop, or change their ways. I read this even recently, and can appreciate the character development even now, while still being immersed in the book. I believe Class Dismissed is an underrated gem.

                <h1>4. The Big Book of Transportation</h1>
                <p1>The Big Book of Transportation  was my introduction to non-fiction, as I had an obsession with trains when I was younger. I wanted to see pictures of trains, especially steam trains. This is one of the reasons I picked up this book at first. Even though the book was above my reading level for the time, I worked through readings I was interested in, mainly the ones about steam trains. Even if I didn’t comprehend all the reading, this was a great introduction to nonfiction for me.

                <h1>5. The Children's Encyclopedia</h1>
                <p1>By this time, my desire for knowledge had expanded past that of transportation. One of the greatest examples of that is <i>The Children’s Encyclopedia</i>, by Discovery Kids. This book also led me to like non-fiction. I learned some surface level knowledge about astronomy, geography, biology, culture, history, politics, and science, all in one book! Even though it is packed with information, the book is still short, yet easy to understand. The entire book is less than 300 pages, while still being understandable by someone around 10 years old.

                <h1>6. Chronicles of Narnia</h1>
                <p1><i>Chronicles of Narnia</i> was my introduction to fantasy, and novel-length fiction. Between the Encyclopedia and this book, I had kind of taken a hiatus from reading. Novel-length fiction never really appealed to me. My dad recommended Chronicles of Narnia for me to read, since he also read C. S. Lewis. I read the book through audio and by reading it. On the topic of audio books, this book taught me the usefulness of audiobooks. Possessing the ability to listen anywhere, doing practically anything. This book also allowed me to use my imagination, much more so than the non-fiction I had been previously reading.

                <h1>7. The Martian</h1>
                <p1>By this point, I had read some fiction on and off, but I hadn’t finished any novels. <i>The Martian</i> was the book to break that streak. Reading this for the bookshelf project proved to be beneficial, since I was able to stay accountable, and not quit halfway through a book. One of my main reasons for quitting a book was getting through slow-paced filler. This wasn’t as much of a problem in this book, which was also my introduction to science fiction. I had long been interested in science fiction, but again, I kept on giving up, unable to get past the filler, The Martian did not have as much of this filler. It was straightforward writing, which I liked much more, and allowed me to finish the book. I loved the sci-fi elements, and the humor. Overall, this was a very enjoyable read, that has led me to want to read more fiction. </p1>

                <h1>8. The Giver</h1>
                <p1><i>The Giver</i> is not like any other book I have read. It doesn’t have a clear genre. It’s a little bit of philosophy, some dystopian elements, and some have even called it a mystery genre. It is also a book that makes you think. Booklist says it best: “The simplicity and directness of Lowry's writing force readers to grapple with their own thoughts.” The book is also short and sweet, less than 250 pages, which kept me engaged the whole way through, it was a breath of fresh air from other fiction books. I’m glad I read something unique and different, and ended up finding a book I liked, and I’ll do so again in the future. </p1>
